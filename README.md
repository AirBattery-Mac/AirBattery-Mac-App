## 📊 Overview  

AirBattery is a compact tool designed to give users a clear, accurate look at the battery levels of their wireless earbuds and compatible Bluetooth devices. Instead of relying on inconsistent system indicators or manually checking charge levels, AirBattery presents real-time battery information in a clean, easy-to-read format. This makes it ideal for users who depend on wireless audio accessories throughout their day.  

The app automatically detects supported earbuds the moment they connect, showing individual charge percentages for each component, including cases when available. This level of detail helps users avoid unexpected power loss during calls, commutes, workouts, or long listening sessions. AirBattery ensures your audio devices are always ready when you need them.  

With a focus on convenience, AirBattery integrates seamlessly into the system interface. Users can enable menu bar indicators, pop-up notifications, or other visual alerts that make monitoring effortless. Its fast and optimized performance ensures it runs quietly in the background without affecting system speed or battery life.  

AirBattery also supports multiple devices, making it suitable for those who frequently switch between different pairs of earbuds or Bluetooth accessories. Whether you're managing a single daily-use pair or juggling several wireless devices, the app keeps essential power information easily accessible and consistently accurate.
